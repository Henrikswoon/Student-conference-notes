ENISA IoT best practises

**Device hardening:** As the entry point into IoT networks,
securing endpoints is crucial. Measures include securely
configuring devices, disabling unnecessary ports or features,
requiring strong passwords, and implementing full-disk
encryption [[HALE-IoT HArdening LEgacy Internet-of-Things devices by retrofitting defensive firmware modifications and]]. Performing security testing via scanning and
penetration testing helps identify vulnerabilities in IoT
hardware and software that need remediation."

**Access control:** Proper access control mechanisms to
authenticate users and devices while limiting authority as per
the principle of least privilege are essential. Techniques like
multi-factor authentication (MFA), single sign-on (SSO) and
centralized identity management help reduce unauthorized
access in IoT environments [16] (!!!).

**Encryption:*** The use of strong, standardized encryption like
TLS 1.3 for communications security and public key
infrastructure (PKI) for identity management is important.
Algorithms like AES for symmetric encryption and RSA for
public-key encryption are commonly implemented [17] (!!!);

**Network security:** Segmenting the IoT network and
monitoring traffic using firewalls and network access control
helps reduce attack surface exposure. Network intrusion
detection and prevention capabilities provide visibility and
block known threats [18] (!!!).

**Patching and upgrades:** Regular patching, software updates
and security upgrades are key given the prevalence of known
vulnerabilities being exploited in IoT ecosystems. Automated
patch deployment solutions help address challenges of scale
and remoteness of IoT devices.

**Activity monitoring:** Monitoring device and network
activity helps quickly detect anomalous behaviors indicating
potential breach attempts or active attacks. Security
information and event management (SIEM) systems and user
behavior analytics (UBA) are common technologies used.

**Incident response:** Having an incident response plan
tailored to IoT environments along with containment
capabilities like device quarantine or network segmentation
helps minimize attack impacts.

End-user education: As IoT expands to consumer settings
like smart homes, user cyber security awareness and training is
crucial for detection and response. Simple password hygiene
measures make a difference.

Regulatory initiatives like the UK and European IoT
security legislation as well as international standardization
efforts will promote better baseline security in IoT products
and systems [21]. In the US, the IoT Cyber security
Improvement Act and NISTIR 8259 [22] publications have
defined IoT security capabilities for government procured
devices that influence wider industry. Growth of cyber
insurance, independent testing and certification programs will
incentivize developers to build more secure IoT devices and
systems.
